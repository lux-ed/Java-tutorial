#  All hail to all of you. 
This is a tutorial-ish summary of 'Java in a Nutshell' book by O'reilly. 

- I have clarified my reasons for doing this in the first PDF. But in addition to that, I know that most of you don't have time -or patience- to read a book. So, in order to give a you all brief, I decided to do this while I am learning myself. It keeps me motivated to know that with the community and with some ambition to learn, we can manage to understand JAVA! 

- If you find a mistake or wish that I provided more information, you can always inform me. Actually, please do. 

- I hope it finds you well. 


- I will be adding more chapters in the following days.
